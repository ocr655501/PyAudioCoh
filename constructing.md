Dual-Mic coherence-based denoising algorithm referenced the link: github.com/wangwei2009/coherence

But implemented something to Python.

Only for reference - I did not write how to export denoised files

**Python 3.10+** is required to use match structure (acts as switch in other languages)

Import plugins required to install:

- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib

**Note:** Only **applyProcess_real.m** is referenced when coding. At this moment I still don't know how to implement a simulation here ... But it should be useful when applying it to real audio files

**Tested under original testaudios**
